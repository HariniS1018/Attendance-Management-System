PROJECT PROPOSAL

1.1 PROJECT TITLE:
Attendance Management System - an Android application

1.2 ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Our project aims to create an Attendance Management System for the Department of Mathematics in the College of Engineering, Guindy Campus. The attendance Management System is an android application that is developed to cater for the needs of Students and Faculty to maintain attendance in a user-friendly digital platform rather than the existing traditional method which is pen and paper form. 
This is a centralized platform that allows every stakeholder of our system to register and maintain attendance securely. We aim to provide teaching staff with an efficient tool to take and track attendance and also for students to keep track of their attendance and ensure to initiate their planned absence to teachers and get feedback. 
This system wholly depends on the database and therefore it is the responsibility of everyone to provide accurate data to the system. It is for maintaining a daily basis of attendance, therefore it is the responsibility of the staff to make student attendance. This system will also provide facilities to update student attendance when medical certificates or on-duty forms are submitted. This system will also alarm the students when the student fails to meet their mandatory attendance amount according to the rules and regulations of the university.
