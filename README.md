## Attendance Management System - Software Development Project

Our project aims to create an Attendance Management System for the Department of Mathematics in the College of Engineering, Guindy Campus. The attendance Management System is an android application that is developed to cater for the needs of Students and Faculty to maintain attendance in a user-friendly digital platform rather than the existing traditional method which is pen and paper form.
